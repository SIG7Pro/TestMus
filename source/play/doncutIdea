Conductor Idea:

Vars:
- BPM
- the rest of the old vars too
public var bpm:Float = 100; // BPM of song.
    public var crotchet:Float = 0; // Duration of a beat calculated from BPM.
    public var offset:Float = 0;
    public var songPosition:Float; // Where you are in the song.
    public var beatNumber:Float;
    public var lastBeat:Float;
// https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/coding-to-the-beat---under-the-hood-of-a-rhythm-game-in-unity
    public var curSongTime:Float;
// Solo Vars
    public var amountBumped:Float = 0; // Variable dedicated to how many bumps occured.

functions:

    when initialized, it gets the bpm, as well as whatever offset it might have (if i find a way to make logic for it)
    perhaps in playstate, audio is loaded from there, and then the position is tracked to the conductor
    song.pos = conductor.songPosition


    think bout this mroe in morning
